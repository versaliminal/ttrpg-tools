Tools for managing and publishing content for Table-Top Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs)

The render.py script can take game content managed as CSVs, render those to LaTex templates, and then generate a PDF from those rendered templates and provided static content.

Rendered examples:
 [Example PDF](docs/examples/example.pdf)  

# Setup
## LaTex
Install a modern LaTex distribution which provides pdflatex such as [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)

## Python environment
To create a valid python environment run the follwoing:
1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`

# Creating a new project
1. Create your templates under projects/{project_name}/templates/
2. Create your source tables under projects/{project_name}/tables/ (you may skip this if you want to refresh from gsheets)
3. Update the projects.yaml file to include your project resources. See the examples in the file for how to do this.

# Rendering your project
Run the render script (add `--refresh` to refresh sources)
`scripts/render.py {project-name}`
Rendered templates will be found under content/rendered
